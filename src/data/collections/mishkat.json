He said, “Now tell me about faith.” He replied, “It means that you should believe in God, His angels, His books, His apostles, and the last day, and that you should believe in the decreeing both of good and evil.\" Remarking that he had spoken the truth, he then said, “Now tell me about doing good.\" He replied, “It means that you should worship God as though you saw Him, for He sees you though you do not see Him.\" He said, “Now tell me about the Hour.\" He replied, “The one who is asked about it is no better informed than the one who is asking.\" He said, “Then tell me about its signs.\" He replied, “That a maid-servant should beget her mistress, and that you should see barefooted, naked, poor men and shepherds exalting themselves in buildings.\" [‘Umar] said: He then went away, and after I had waited for a long time [the Prophet] said to me, “Do you know who the questioner was, ‘Umar?\" I replied, “God and His messenger know best.\" He said, “He was Gabriel who came to you to teach you your religion.\"\n\nMuslim transmitted it.",

I was then about to remove his shoes when he said, “Leave them, for my feet were pure when I put them in”; so he rubbed over them, and he and I mounted our beasts and came to the people. They had begun the prayer with ‘Abd ar-Rahman b. ‘Auf leading them, and he had performed a rak'a with them, but when he was aware of the Prophet’s presence he began to retire. The Prophet, however, signed to him to continue and performed one of the rak'as along with him. Then when he had pronounced the salutation the Prophet got up, and I got up along with him, and we performed the rak‘a which had been finished before we came. \n\nMuslim transmitted it.",

He asked what next they disputed about, and when I said it was about degrees, He asked what they were and I replied, ‘Providing food, speaking gently, and praying at night when people are asleep.’ He then told me to make a request, and I said, ‘O God, I ask Thee for power to do good things and abandon objectionable things, for love towards the poor, that Thou shouldest forgive me and show mercy to me, and that when Thou intendest to test any people Thou wilt take me to Thyself without being led astray. And I ask for Thy love, the love of those who love Thee, and a love of doing things which will bring me near to Thy love.’” Then God’s Messenger said, “It is true, so study it and learn it.” \n\nAhmad and Tirmidhi transmitted it, and Tirmidhi said, “This is a hasan sahih tradition.

They said, “You have spoken the truth. This is how he used to pray.” \n\n *i.e. prostration\n\nAbu Dawud and Darimi transmitted it. And Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah transmitted something to the same effect. Tirmidhi saying that this is a hasan sahih tradition.\n\nThen he bowed and placed his hands on his knees as though he were clutching them, and he bent his arms and kept them away from his sides. He (i.e. the narrator) said that he then prostrated himself placing his nose and his forehead on the ground, keeping his arms away from his sides, placing the palms of his hands [on the ground] opposite his shoulders, keeping his thighs separate and not letting his stomach press on any part of his thighs till he finished; then he sat up and spread out his left foot, putting forward the front of his right foot towards his qibla, placing the palm of his right hand on his right knee and the palm of his left hand on his left knee, and he pointed with his finger, i.e., his forefinger. In another version by him [it says]: When he sat at the end of two rak'as he sat on the sole of his left foot and raised the right, and after the fourth he placed his left hip on the ground and put out both feet on one side.\n\nA version by Abu Dawud of the tradition of Abu Humaid.",

I said, “Messenger of God, I have only recently been a pagan, but God has brought Islam to us, and among us there are men who have recourse to kahins.”2 He replied, “Do not have recourse to them.” I said, “Among us there are men who take omens.” He replied, “That is something which they find in their breasts, but let it not turn them away [from freedom of action]”.

(Ibn Sirin said that Abu Huraira named it, but he had forgotten which, it was.) He led us in two rak'as and when he had given the salutation he got up, and going towards a piece of wood which was placed crosswise in the mosque, he leaned on it looking as if he were angry. He placed his right hand on his left, and intertwining his fingers, he placed his right cheek on the back of his left hand. Those who were first to come out of the doors of the mosque said, “The prayer has been shortened.\" Abu Bakr and ‘Umar were among the people, but they were too afraid to speak to him; but among them was a man with such long arms that he was called “The possessor of arms\" (Dhulyadain) who asked, “Have you forgotten, Messenger of God, or has the prayer been shortened?” He replied, “I have neither forgotten, nor has it been shortened.\" He then asked whether things were as the possessor of arms had said, and when he was told that that was so he went forward and prayed what he had omitted. He then gave the salutation, then said “God is most great\" and made his usual prostration or one a little longer, then raised his head and said “God is most great\", then said “God is most great\" and made his usual prostration or one a little longer, then raised his head and said “God is most great\". He2 was often asked whether he then gave the salutation and he would say: I have been informed that ‘Imran b. Husain said he then gave the salutation. \n\n    1. ‘Ashiy generally means evening, but it also means the time between the declining of the sun after the meridian and sunset or morning, so the two prayers here mentioned are the noon (zuhr) prayer and the afternoon prayer.\n    2. i.e. Ibn Sirin\n\n(Bukhari and Muslim, the wording being Bukhari’s.)

When he returned he said: I swear by God that I have come to you from him who is truly the Prophet. He said, “Pray such and such a prayer at such and such a time, and such and such a prayer at such and such a time. When the time of prayer comes one of you should call the >i>adhan and the one of you who knows most of the Qur’an should act as your imam” So they considered, and there was no one who knew more of the Our’an than I did because of what I had received from the riders.

I wore a mantle which, when I prostrated myself, went up on me, and a woman of the clan said, “Why do you not cover the backside of your reader from us?” So they bought and cut out a shirt for me, and I have never been so pleased about anything as I was about that shirt. \n\nBukhari transmitted it.",

Afterwards the Prophet experienced some improvement in his condition and went out between two men, one of whom was al-‘Abbas, to the noon prayer when Abu Bakr was leading the people.

    "content": "Al-Bara' b. ‘Azib said : We went out with the Prophet to the funeral of a man of the Ansar and came to the grave. It had not yet been dug, so God’s messenger sat down and we sat down around him quietly. He had in his hand a stick with which he was making marks on the ground. Then he raised his head and said, “Seek refuge in God from the punishment of the grave saying it twice or thrice. He then said, “When a believer is about to leave the world and go forward to the next world, angels with faces white as the sun come down to him from heaven with one of the shrouds of paradise and some of the perfume of paradise and sit away from him as far as the eye can see. Then the angel of death comes and sits at his head and says, 'Good soul, come out to forgiveness and acceptance from God.' It then comes out as a drop flows from a water-skin and he seizes it; and when he does so, they do not leave it in his hand for an instant, but take it and place it in that shroud and that perfume, and from it there comes forth a fragrance like that of the sweetest musk found on the face of the earth. They then take it up and do not bring it past a company of angels without their asking, “Who is this good soul?' to which they reply, ‘So and so, the son of so and so,’ using the best of his names by which people called him on the earth. They then bring him to the lowest heaven and ask that the gate should be opened for him. This is done, and from every heaven its archangels escort him to the next heaven till he is brought to the seventh heaven, and God who is great and glorious says, ‘Record the book of my servant in ‘Illiyun (Cf. Qur’an, lxxxiii, 18) and take him back to earth, for I created mankind from it, I shall return them into it, and from it I shall bring them forth another time.' His soul is then restored to his body, two angels come to him, and making him sit up say to him, ‘Who is your Lord?’ He replies, ‘My Lord is God.’ They ask, ‘What is your religion?’ and he replies, ‘My religion is Islam.’ They ask, ‘Who is this man who was sent among you?’ and he replies, ‘He is God’s messenger.’ They ask, ‘What is your [source of] knowledge?’ and he replies, ‘I have read God’s Book, believed in it and declared it to be true.’ Then one cries from heaven, ‘My servant has spoken the truth, so spread out carpets from paradise for him, clothe him from paradise, and open a gate for him into paradise.’ Then some of its joy and fragrance comes to him, his grave is made spacious for him as far as the eye can see, and a man with a beautiful face, beautiful garments and a sweet odour comes to him and says, ‘Rejoice in what pleases you for this is your day which you have been promised.' He asks, ‘Who are you, for your face is perfectly beautiful and brings good?” He replies, ‘I am your good deeds.’ He then says, ‘My Lord, bring the last hour; my Lord, bring the last hour, so that I may return to my people and my property.’ But when an infidel is about to leave the world and proceed to the next world, angels with black faces come down to him from heaven with hair-cloth and sit away from him as far as the eye can see. Then the angel of death comes and sits at his head and says, ‘Wicked soul, come out to displeasure from God.’ Then it becomes dissipated in his body, and he draws it out as a spit is drawn out from moistened wool. He then seizes it, and when he does so they do not leave it in his hand for an instant, but put it in that hair-cloth and from it there comes forth a stench like the most offensive stench of a corpse found on the face of the earth. They then take it up and do not bring it past a company of angels without their asking, ‘Who is this wicked soul?’ to which they reply, ‘So and so, the son of so and so,’ using the worst names he was called in the world. When he is brought to the lowest heaven request is made that the gate be opened for him, but it is not opened for him. (God’s messenger then recited, ‘The gates of heaven will not be opened for them and they will not enter paradise until a camel can pass through the eye of a needle.)(Qur'an, vii, 40) God who is great and glorious then says, ‘Record his book in Sijjin (Cf. Qur’an, Ixxxiii, 7 ff) in the lowest earth,’ and his soul is thrown down. (He then recited, ‘He who assigns partners to God is as if he had fallen down from heaven and been snatched up by birds, or made to fall by the wind in a place far distant.')(Qur’an, xxii, 31). His soul is then restored to his body, two angels come to him, and making him sit up say to him, ‘Who is your Lord?’. He replies, ‘Alas, alas, I do not know.’ They ask, ‘What is your religion?' and he replies, ‘Alas, alas, I do not know.’ They ask, ‘Who is this man who was sent among you?' and he replies, ‘Alas, alas, I do not know.’ Then one cries from heaven, ‘He has lied, so spread out carpets from hell for him, and open a gate for him into hell.’ Then some of its heat and hot air comes to him, his grave is made narrow for him so that his ribs are pressed together in it, and a man with an ugly, face, ugly garments and an offensive odour come to him and says, ‘Be grieved with what displeases you, for this is your day which you have been promised.’ He asks, ‘Who are you, for your face is most ugly and brings evil?' He replies, ‘I am your wicked deeds.’ He then says, ‘My Lord, do not bring the last hour.’ ” In a version there is something similar containing an addition: “When his soul comes out every angel between heaven and earth and every angel in heaven invoke blessings on him, and the gates of heaven are opened for him, no guardians of a gate failing to supplicate God that his soul may be taken up beyond them. But his soul, i.e., the infidel’s, is pulled out along with the veins and every angel between heaven and earth and every angel in heaven curse him, and the gates of heaven are locked, no guardians of a gate failing to supplicate God that his soul may not be taken up beyond them. \n\nAhmad transmitted it.",

He therefore returned to Suhaib and told him to come over and attach himself to the Commander of the Faithful. Then when ‘Umar was smitten Suhaib entered weeping and saying, “Alas for the brother! Alas for the companion!” ‘Umar asked Suhaib if he was weeping for him when God’s messenger had said that the dead would certainly be punished because of some of the weeping of his family for him. Ibn ‘Abbas said that when ‘Umar died he mentioned that to ‘A’isha and she said, “God have mercy on ‘Umar! I answer by God that God’s messenger never said the dead will certainly be punished because of his family’s weeping for him; what he said was that God will increase the punishment of the infidel because of his family’s weeping for him.” She added, “What the Qur’an says is enough for you: ‘No bearer of a burden will bear another’s burden.’ ” (Qur’an, vi, 164; xvii, 15; xxxv, 18; xxxix, 7) Thereupon Ibn ‘Abbas said, “God is He who has caused laughter and weeping.” (Cf.

By Him in whose hand my soul is, whoever takes any of it will inevitably bring it on the day of resurrection carrying it on his neck, be it a camel which rumbles, an ox which bellows, or a sheep which bleats.” \nThen raising his arms so that we could see the place where the hair grew under his armpits he said, \"O God, have I given full information? O God, have I given full information?” \n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.) \n\nKhattabi said: The words \"Why did he not sit in his father’s or his mother's house and see whether it would be given to him or not?” are a proof that every matter which, when it is adopted, leads to something forbidden is itself forbidden, and that note is taken of everyone who enters into covenants as to whether or not his decision made by himself is like his decision when he is associated with others.

This is the obligatory sadaqa which God’s messenger imposed on the Muslims which God commanded him to impose. Those Muslims who are asked for the proper amount must give it, but those who are asked for more than that must not give it. For twenty-four camels or less, a sheep is to be given for every five. When they reach twenty-five to thirty-five, a she-camel in her second year is to be given. When they reach thirty-six to forty-five, a she-camel in her third year is to be given. When they reach forty-six to sixty, a she-camel in her fourth year which is ready to be covered by a stallion is to be given. When they reach sixty-one to seventy-five, a she-camel in her fifth year is to be given. When they reach seventy-six to ninety, two she-camels in their third year are to be given. When they reach ninety-one to a hundred and twenty, two she-camels in their fourth year which are ready to be covered by a stallion are to be given. When they exceed a hundred and twenty, a she-camel in her third year is to be given for every forty and a she-camel in her fourth year for every fifty. If anyone has only four camels, no sadaqa is payable on them unless their owner wishes, but when they reach five a sheep is payable on them. If anyone whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her fifth year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her fourth year, that will be accepted from him along with two sheep if he can conveniently give them, or else twenty dirhams. If anyone whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her fourth year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her fifth year, that will be accepted from him, and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two sheep. If anyone whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her fourth year is payable possesses only one in her third year, that will be accepted from him along with two sheep or twenty dirhams. If any one whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her third year is payable possesses one in her fourth year, that will be accepted from him, and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two sheep. If anyone whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her third year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her second year, that will be accepted from him, and he must give along with it twenty dirhams or two sheep.

Concerning the sadaqa on sheep which are pasturing, when they number from forty to a hundred and twenty, a sheep is to be given. On over a hundred and twenty up to two hundred two sheep are to be given. On over two hundred up to three hundred three sheep are to be given. If they exceed three hundred, a sheep is to be given for every hundred. If a man’s pasturing animals are one less than forty no sadaqa is due on them unless their owner wishes. An old sheep, one with a defect in the eye, or a male goat is not to be brought forth as sadaqa unless the collector is willing. Those which are in separate flocks are not to be brought together and those which are in one flock are not to be separated from fear of sadaqa. * Regarding what belongs to two partners, they can make claims for restitution from one another with equity.

He therefore sent to them an angel who came to the leper and asked him what he would like best and he replied, “A good colour, a good skin, and to be rid of what makes me loathsome to people.” Thereupon he stroked him and his loathsomeness departed and he was given a good colour and a good skin. He then asked What property he would like best and he replied that he would like camels—or perhaps he said cattle, for Ishaq* was uncertain, but either the leper or bald man said camels and the other said cattle. He was given a she-camel ten months gone with young, the angel expressing the wish that God’s blessing might accompany it. \nHe then went to the bald man and asked him what he would like best and he replied, \"Good hair, and to be rid of what makes me loathsome to people.” Thereupon he stroked him and it departed from him and he was given good hair. He then asked what property he would like best and he replied that he would like cattle, so he was given a pregnant cow, the angel expressing the wish that God’s blessing might accompany it. \nHe then went to the blind man and asked him what he would like best, and he replied, \"That God should restore my sight to me so that I may see people.” Thereupon he stroked him and God restored his sight to him. He then asked what property he would like best and he replied that he would like sheep, so he was given a pregnant ewe. \nFlocks and herds were produced for the three men, the one having a wadi with camels, the second one with cattle, and the third one with sheep. Then the angel came to the one who had been a leper in the form and appearance of a leper and said, “I am a poor man whose resources are exhausted in my journey, and my only means of arriving at my destination are dependent on God and then on you, so I ask you by Him who gave you the good colour, the good skin and the property for a camel by which I may get to the end of my journey,” but he replied, \"I have many dues to pay.” He then said, \"I seem to recognise you. Were you not a leper whom people found loathsome and a poor man to whom God gave property?” He replied, \"I became heir to this property as one great in dignity from one great in dignity.”** Then he said, \"If you are lying, may God return you to your former condition.” \nHe went to the one who had been bald in the form of a bald man and said the same as he had said to the other and received a similar reply, so he said, \"If you are lying, may God return you to your former condition.” \nHe then went to the one who had been blind in the form and appearance of a blind man and said, \"I am a poor man and a traveller whose resources are exhausted in my journey, and my only means of arriving at my destination are dependent on God and then on you, so I ask you by Him who restored your sight to you for a sheep by which I may get to the end of my journey.\" He replied, “I have been blind and God restored my sight to me, so take what you wish and leave what you wish. I swear by God that I shall not importune you today for anything you take, as I give it for God's sake.\" \nHe said, “Keep your property, for you have all simply been put to a test, and God is pleased with you and displeased with your two companions.” \n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)\n\n* Ishaq b.

I seek from God that fasting on the day of ‘Arafa may atone for the sins of the preceding and the coming year, and I seek from God that fasting on the day of ‘Ashura’ may atone for the sins of the preceding year.” \n\nMuslim transmitted it.",

He asks whether they have seen it, and when they reply, “No indeed, my Lord, they have not seen it,” He asks how they would act if they had seen it, to which they reply, “If they had seen it they would have been more earnest in flying from it and fearing it.” He then says, “I call you to witness that I have forgiven them.” One of the angels says, “Among them is so and so who does not belong to their number, but has come only for something he wants,” and He replies, “They are people who are seated together, and he who sits with them will not be miserable.” \n\nBukhari transmitted it.\n\nIn Muslim's version he said that God has angels who travel round to a great extent looking for meetings where remembrance is being made of God, and when they find a meeting where this is being done they sit with them and surround one another, with their wings so as to fill the space between them and the lowest heaven. When the people separate they ascend up to heaven, and God who knows best asks them where they have come from. They reply, “We have come from Thy servants on the earth who are extolling and magnifying Thee, declaring Thy unity, praising Thee and making request of Thee.” He says, “For what are they asking me?” and they reply, “They are asking Thee for Thy paradise.” He asks whether they have seen His paradise, and when they reply, “No my Lord.” He asks how they would act if they had seen His paradise. They say, “They are also seeking Thy protection.” He asks, “From what are they seeking my protection?” and they reply, “From Thy fire.” He asks whether they have seen His fire, and when they reply that they have not, He asks how they would act if they had seen His fire. They say, “They are also asking Thy forgiveness,” to which He replies, “I have forgiven them, given them what they have asked for, and protected them from what they sought protection.” They say, “My Lord, so and so, a sinner, is among them, who just happening to pass by sat down with them.” He replies, “Him also I have forgiven.

    "content": "‘Abdallah b. ‘Amr b. al-‘As reported God’s messenger as saying there are two characteristics which will not be retained by any Muslim without his entering paradise. While they are easy, those who act upon them are few. One should say ‘Glory be to God’ ten times after every prayer, ‘Praise be to God’ ten times and ‘God is most great’ ten times. (He said he had seen God’s messenger counting them on his hand, and saying, “That is a hundred and fifty on the tongue, but one thousand five hundred in the scale”).[The three phrases each said ten times after the five times of prayer makes a hundred and fifty, and as a good deed gets a ten-fold reward the total is treated as one thousand five hundred.] When he goes to his bed he should say ‘Glory be to God,’ ‘God is most Great’ and ‘Praise be to God’ a hundred times, for that is a hundred on the tongue, but a thousand in the scale. He asked them which of them could commit two thousand five hundred sins in a day and a night.* He was asked how they could not retain these characteristics, and told them that the devil comes to a man while he is engaged in prayer, calling such and such and such and such to his memory until he turns away and perhaps may not do it. He also comes to him on his bed and keeps on making him sleep till he falls asleep.\n*The thousand plus the preceding fifteen hundred make two thousand five hundred good deeds with which the man who observes the two characteristics mentioned is credited, and as one could hardly commit as many sins in a day and a night there is a balance in his favour.\n\nTirmidhi, Abu Dawud and Nasa’i transmitted it. In Abu Dawud's version he said, “Two qualities or two characteristics will not be adhered to by a Muslim ...” And also in his version after saying “One thousand five hundred in the scale” he said, “When he goes to his bed he should say ‘God is most great’ thirty-four times, ‘Praise be to God’ thirty-three times and ‘Glory be to God’ thirty-three times.” In most texts of al-Masabih it is given on the authority of ‘Abdallah b. ‘Umar.",

Large numbers came to Medina, and we went out with him. When we reached Dhul Hulaifa, Asma’ daughter of ‘Umais, gave birth to Muhammad b. Abu Bakr and sent to God’s messenger asking what she was to do. He replied, “Bathe, bandage your private parts with a cloth, and put on the ihram.” God’s messenger then prayed in the mosque, and after he had mounted al-Qaswa' and his she-camel stood erect with him on its back at al-Baida’, he raised his voice declaring God’s unity and saying, “Labbaik, O God, labbaik labbaik; Thou hast no partner; labbaik; praise and grace are Thine and the dominion; Thou hast no partner.” Jabir said : We did not express our intention of performing anything but the hajj, being unaware of the ‘umra [at that season], but when we came with him to the House he touched the corner and made seven circuits, running three of them and walking four. Then going forward to the station of Abraham, he recited, “And take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.” (Qur’an 2:125)He then prayed two 'rak'as, having the station between him and the House. A version says that he recited in the two rak'as,. “Say, He is God, One,” and, “Say, O infidels.” (Qur’an 112, and 109) He then returned to the corner and touched it, after which he went out by the gate to as-Safa, on coming near to which he recited. “As-Safa and al-Marwa are among the signs appointed by God,” (Qur’an 2:158) adding, “I begin with what God began with.” So he went first to as-Safa, and mounting it till he could see the House, he faced the qibla, declared God's unity, proclaimed His greatness, and said, “There is no god but God alone who has no partner; to Him belongs the dominion, to Him praise is due, and He is omnipotent; there is no god but God alone who alone has fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates.\" He then made supplication in the course of that, saying such words three times. He next descended and walked towards al-Marwa, and when his feet came down into the bottom of the valley he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached al-Marwa. There he did as he had done at as-Safa, and when he came to al-Marwa for the last time, he called out, he being on al-Marwa and the people below him, saying, “If I had known before what I have come to know afterwards regarding my religion, I would not have brought sacrificial animals but made it an 'umra ; so if any of you has no sacrificial animals he,may take off the ihram and treat it as an ‘umra. Suraqa b. Malik b.Jush'um then got up and asked, “Messenger of God, does this apply to the present year, or does it apply for ever?\" God’s messenger intertwined his fingers and said twice, “The ‘umra has become incorporated in the hajj,\" adding “No, but for ever and ever.\" ‘Ali came from the Yemen with the Prophet’s sacrificial animals and he asked him what he had said when he undertook the duty of performing the hajj. He replied that he had said, “0 God, I am putting on the ihram for the same purpose as Thy messenger has put it on.\" He said, “I have with me the sacrificial animals, so do not put off the ihram.” [Jabir] said: The total of those sacrificial animals brought by ‘Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the Prophet was a hundred. Then all the people, except the Prophet and those who had with them sacrificial animals, removed the ihram and clipped their hair. When yaum at-tarwiya (The 8th of Dhul Hijja, the day when pilgrims leave Mecca and go to Mina. The name is commonly explained as meaning that this was the day when the pilgrims provided themselves with a supply of water for the arid journey before them) came they went towards Mina having put on the ihram for the hajj, and the Prophet rode and prayed there the noon, afternoon, sunset, evening and dawn prayers. After that he waited a little till the sun rose, and gave orders for a tent of hair to be set up for him at Namira (A place or a hill near ‘Arafa). God’s messenger then set out, and Quraish did not doubt that he would observe a halt at the sacred site (At al-Muzdalifa, al-Mash'ar al-haram, a hill sacred to the god Ouzah in pre-lslamic times), as Quraish used to do in the pre-Islamic period ; but he passed on till he came to ‘Arafa and found that the tent had been set up for him at Namira. There he dismounted, and when the sun had passed the meridian he ordered al- Qaswa’ to be brought, and when it was saddled for him he went down into the valley and addressed the people, saying, “Your lives and your property must be respected by one another like the sacredness of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours. Everything pertaining to the pre-Islamic period has been put under my feet, and claims for blood-vengeance belonging to the pre-lslamic period have been abolished. The first of those murdered among us whose blood-vengeance I remit is the son of Rabi'a b. al-Harith (Rabi’a was a grandson of 'Abd al-Muttalib. The name of the child who had been killed is variously given as Adam, Tammam and Iyas. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr says Adam is a mistake, but does not commit himself to either of the other two names) who was suckled among the B. Sa'd and killed by Hudhail. The usury of the pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the first of our usury I abolish is that of ‘Abbas b. ‘Abd al-Muttalib, for it is all abolished. Show fear towards God regarding women, for you have got them under God’s security, and have the right to intercourse with them by God's word. They must not bring into your houses anyone whom you dislike, but if they do that beat them, though not severely. You are responsible for providing them with their food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you something, i.e. God’s Book, by which, if you hold to it, you will never again go astray. You will be asked about me, so what will you say?\" They replied, “We testify that you have conveyed and fulfilled the message and given counsel. ” Then raising his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people, he said, “O God, be witness ; O God, be witness,” saying it three times. Bilal then uttered the call to prayer, and the iqama, and he prayed the noon prayer; he then uttered the iqama and he prayed the afternoon prayer, engaging in no prayer between the two. He then mounted his camel and came to the place of standing, making his she-camel al-Qaswa’ turn its back to the rocks and having the path taken by those who went on foot (The Arabic is Habl al-mushat, which is variously explained as above, or as ‘the concourse of horse on foot', or as the name of a place.) in front of him. He faced the qibla and remained standing till sunset when the yellow light had somewhat gone and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He took Usama up behind him and went quickly till he came to al-Muzdalifa, where he prayed the sunset and the evening prayer with one adhan and two iqamas without saying ‘Glory be to God' between them. He then lay down till dawn and prayed the dawn prayer with an adhan and an iqama when the morning light was clear. He then mounted al-Qaswa’ and when he came to the sacred site he faced the qibla, supplicated God, declared His greatness, His uniqueness and His unity, and kept standing till the daylight was very clear. He then went quickly before the sun rose, taking al-Fadl b. ‘Abbas behind him, and came to the valley of Muhassir (Between al-Muzdalifa and Mini). He urged the camel a little and following the middle road which comes out at the greatest jamra (Jamra, originally a pebble, is applied to a heap of stones, of which there are three in the valley of Mina. One of the rites of the hajj is to throw small stones at them), he came to the jamra which is beside the tree. At this he threw seven small pebbles (Literally, 'pebbles that are thrown’: used to indicate small pebbles about the size of a date-stone), saying “God is most great” each time he threw a pebble. He threw them from the bottom of the valley, then went to the place of sacrifice and sacrificed sixty-three victims with his own hand. Then he gave some to ‘Ali who sacrificed the remainder, and he shared with him in his sacrificial animals. After that he ordered that a piece of flesh from each victim should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked the two of them ate some of it and drank some of its broth. Then God’s messenger mounted, and going quickly to the House, prayed the noon prayer in Mecca. He came to the B. ‘Abd al-Muttalib who were supplying water at Zamzam and said, “Draw water, B. ‘Abd al-Muttalib. Were it not that people would take from you the right to draw water, I would draw it along with you.” So they handed him a bucket and he drank from it. \n\nMuslim transmitted it.",

Those who cannot get sacrificial animals should fast three days during the hajj and seven days when they return to their families.” He performed the circumambulation when he came to Mecca, first touching the corner (The corner of the Ka'ba containing the Black Stone), then running during three circuits and walking during four, and when he had finished his circumambulation of the House he prayed two rak'as at the Station (Maqam Ibrahim), then giving the salutation, and departing, he went to as-Safa and went seven times between as-Safa and al-Marwa.

As it was only five days before they were due at ‘Arafa, they said he had ordered them to go in to their wives and so they would come to ‘Arafa with their penises dripping with prostatic fluid. He said that Jabir made a gesture, moving his hand, and he could still imagine himself looking at him (Perhaps the gesture was meant to indicate that they could have shaken off the fluid). The Prophet then got up among them and said, “You know that I am the most godfearing, truthful and pious one among you. Were it not that I have sacrificial animals I would have removed the ihram as you are doing, and had I known beforehand about my affair what I have come to know later I would not have brought sacrificial animals ; so remove the ihram.'’ They did so, hearing and obeying. ‘Ata’ quoted Jabir as saying that ‘Ali arrived after his expedition to collect the poor rate and he asked him for what he had raised his voice in the talbiya. He replied that he had done it for the same purpose as the Prophet, so God's messenger said to him, “Bring the sacrificial animals and remain in the sacred state.” He said that ‘Ali brought sacrificial animals for him and that Suraqa b.

The year contains twelve months of which four are sacred, three of them consecutive, viz. Dhul Qa'da, Dhul Hijja. and Muharram, and also Rajab of Mudar which comes between Jumada and Sha'ban.”( The month Rajab is here connected with the North Arabian tribe of Mudar because they are said to have honoured it greatly and never to have broken its sacred nature. The precise reference to its place among the months is said’to be for the purpose of removing any doubt about it owing to the earlier practice of periodically intercalating a month) He asked, “What month is this?\" and when the people replied that God and His messenger knew best, he remained silent so that they thought he would give it a new name, but he said, “Is it not Dhul Hijja?\" and they replied that it was. He asked, “What town is this?\" and when the people replied that God and His apostle knew best, he remained silent so that they thought he would give it a new name, but he said, “Is it not al-Balda?”( This word occurs a number of times in the Qur’an in the general sense of a district, but in 27, 91 it is used particularly of Mecca which is there called “this district (balda)\". In the tradition the word seems to be used as if it were a proper name) and they replied that it was. He asked, “What day is this?” and when the people replied that God and His messenger knew best, he remained silent so that they thought he would give it a new name, but he said, “Is it not the day of sacrifice?\" and they replied that it was. He said, “Your lives, property and honour must be regarded by you with a sacredness like that of this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. O, do not revert after my death to being people who are astray, beheading one another. Have I delivered the message ?\" When they replied that he had he said, “O God, testify ; and let him who is present convey it to him who is absent, for many a one to whom a message is conveyed has a more retentive memory than the one who hears.” \n\nBukhari and Muslim.",

Go back, ask God's forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance.” He said that he went back not very far, then came and said, “Purify me, Messenger of God,” and the Prophet said the same as he had said before. When this went on till a fourth time he asked, “For what am I to purify you?” and he replied that it was because of fornication. God’s Messenger then asked if the man was mad, and when he was told that he was not, he asked if he had drunk wine. A man got up and smelt his breath but noticed no smell of wine, so the Prophet asked him if he had committed fornication, and when he replied that he had, he gave orders regarding him and he was stoned to death. Two or three days later God’s Messenger came and said, “Ask forgiveness for Ma'iz b. Malik. He has repented to such an extent that if it were divided among a people it would be enough for them all.” Then a woman of Ghamid, a branch of Azd came to him and said, “Purify me, Messenger of God.” He replied, “Out upon you! Go back, ask God’s forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance.” She said, “Do you want to send me back as you did to Ma'iz b. Malik when I am 1 pregnant as a result of fornication?” He asked whether she was referring to herself, and when she replied that she was, he told her to wait till she had given birth to what was in her womb. One of the Ansar became responsible for her till she was delivered of a child, and then went to the Prophet and told him that the woman of Ghamid had given birth to a child. He said, \"In that case we shall not stone her and so leave her child as an infant with no one to suckle him.” One of the Ansar then got up and said, \"I shall be responsible for his suckling, Prophet of God.\" He then had her stoned to death. A version says that he told her to go away till she gave birth to a child, then when she did, he told her to go away and suckle him till she had weaned him. When she had weaned him she brought the boy to him with a piece of bread in his hand and said, \"I have weaned this one and he has eaten food.\" He (hen handed the boy over to one of the Muslims, and when he had given command regarding her and she was put in a hole up to her breast, he ordered the people to stone her. Khalid b. al-Walid came forward with a stone which he threw at her head, and when the blood spurted on his face he cursed her, but the Prophet said, \"Gently, Khalid, By Him in whose hand my soul is, she has repented to such an extent that if one who wrongfully takes an extra tax 2 were to repent to a like extent he would be forgiven.\" Then giving command regarding her, he prayed over her and she was buried. \n\nMuslim transmitted it.\n\n    1. The Arabic uses the third person, saying she was pregnant. It may be an explanatory phrase, but I have ventured to treat it as part of the woman's word since this makes the sentence read a little more easily.\n    2. Sahib maks. Maks was money taken from sellers in the market in pre-Islamic times; it is also used of something taken by a tax-collector over and above that is duo.",

When he came to the mountain pass by which one descends to Mecca his riding-beasts knelt down and the people said, “Go on, go on! Al-Qaswa’ has become jaded.” But the Prophet said, “Al- Qaswa’ has not become jaded, for that is not a characteristic of hers, but He who restrained the elephant1 has restrained her.” Then he said, “By Him in whose hand my soul is, they will not ask me any good thing by which they honour what God has made sacred without my giving them it.” He then urged her and she leaped up and he turned aside from the road to Mecca and stopped at the farthest point of al-Hudaibiya at a pool with little water which the people collected in small quantities and soon exhausted. Complaint of thirst was made to God’s Messenger, so he drew an arrow from his quiver and ordered them to put it in it, whereupon to their astonishment it kept gushing out to them with water till they left it. Meanwhile Budail b. Warqa’ al Khuza’i came with some members of Khuza’a and ‘Urwa b. Mas'ud joined him. He went on with the tradition2 to the point where he said that when Suhail b. ‘Amr came the Prophet said, “Write: This is what Muhammad God's Messenger has decided.” Suhail protested, “I swear by God that if we knew you were God’s Messenger we would not turn you away from the House or fight with you; but write: Muhammad b. ‘Abdallah.” The Prophet replied, “I swear by God that I am God’s Messenger even if you disbelieve me; write Muhammad b. ‘Abdallah.” Suhail said, “And that a man will not come to you from us, even if he follows your religion, without your sending him back to us.\" Then when he finished drawing up the document God’s Messenger said to his companions, \"Get up and sacrifice, and then shave.” Thereafter some believing women came and God most high sent down, \"O you who believe, when believing women come to you as emigrants…”3 God most high forbade them to send them back, but ordered them to restore the dower. When the Prophet returned to Medina Abu Basir, a man of Quraish who was a Muslim, came to him and they sent two men to look for him, so he handed him over to the two men. They took him away, and when they reached Dhul Hulaifa and alighted to eat some dates which they had Abu Basir said to one of the men, \"I swear by God, so and so, that I think this sword of yours is a fine one; let me look at it.” He let him have it and he struck him till he died, whereupon the other fled from him and when he reached Medina went running into the mosque. The Prophet said, “This man has seen something frightful.” He said, “I swear by God that my companion has been killed, and I am as good as dead.”4 Abu Basir arrived and the Prophet said, \"Woe to his mother, stirrer up of war! Would that he had some kinsfolk!”5 When he heard that he knew that he would send him back to them, so he went out and came to the seashore. Abu Jandal b. Suhail escaped and joined Abu Basir, and it became the practice that every man of Quraish who went out having accepted Islam joined Abu Basir, till a band of them collected. Whenever they heard of a caravan which belonged to Quraish going out to Syria they intercepted it, killed the men and seized their goods; so Quraish sent a message to the Prophet adjuring him by God and the ties of relationship to send instructions to them to stop, and agreeing that anyone who came to him would be safe. So the Prophet sent them instructions. \n\n    1. Cf. Al-Qur'an; 105.\n    2. This indicates that a part of Bukhari’s tradition is omitted here.\n    3. Al-Qur'an; 60:10.\n    4.

They went out with God’s messenger to the Trench, and that young man was asking permission from God’s messenger to leave after staying half the day and would return to his wife. One day when he asked God's messenger’s permission he told him to carry his weapons with him as he feared Quraiza might do him harm. The man took his weapons and returned, and finding his wife standing between the two doors he was smitten with jealousy and made to pierce her with his lance, but she told him to put away his lance and enter the house to see what had made her come out. He entered and found a huge snake coiled on the bedding, so he made for it with the lance and pierced it with it and then went out and fixed it in the ground in the house, but the snake quivered and attacked him, and no one knew which of them died first, the snake or the young man. They went to God's messenger and mentioned that incident to him, asking him to supplicate God to restore him to life for them, but he replied, \"Ask forgiveness for your friend.\" Then he said, \"These houses have resident jinn, so when you see one of them give it a warning three times. 1 If it goes away, well and good; otherwise kill it, for it is an infidel.''

Tie up you buckets, mentioning God's name; cover up your vessels, mentioning God’s name, even though you should just put something on them, and extinguish your lamps.”\n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.) In a version by Bukhari he said, “Cover up the vessels, tie the water-skins, shut the doors, and gather your children in the evening, for the jinn are abroad and seize them; and extinguish the lamps when you go to sleep, for a mouse often drags a wick and burns a household.” In a verison by Muslim he said, “Cover the vessel, tie up the water-skin, shut the doors and extinguish the lamp, for the devil does not loosen a water-skin, or open a door, or uncover a vessel. If all one can do is to put a piece of wood over his vessel and mention God's name let him do so, for a mouse sets a house on fire over its inhabitants.” In a version by him he said, “Do not let your animals and children go at large when the sun sets till the first and darkest part of the night has passed, for the devil is sent out; from the time the sun sets till the first and darkest part of the night is past.” In a version by him he said, “Cover the vessel and tie up the water-skin, for there is a night in the year when pestilence descends, and it does not pass an uncovered vessel or an untied water-skin without some of that pesti- lence descending into it.”",

One day he asked us, “Has any of you had a vision?” and when we replied that we had not he said:\n“But last night I saw two men who came to me, took me by the hand and brought me out to a holy land. I saw a man sitting and a man standing with a hooked piece of iron in his hand which he was inserting into the other man's jaw and cleaving it till it reached the back of his neck, and doing the same with the other jaw. This jaw was recovering, and then he would do the same again. I asked what this was and they told me to come away. So we went on till we came to a man who was lying on his back over whom a man was standing with a stone the size of his hand, or a rock, with which he was pounding his head. When he struck him the stone rolled away and he went after it to get it, and did not return to this man till his head was healed and restored to its former condition. He then went back to him and struck him. I asked what this was and they told me to come away. So we went on till we came to a hole like an oven, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, under which there was a fire. It contained naked men and women who when the fire rose mounted till they almost came out, but who returned into it when it subsided. I asked what this was and they told me to come away. So we went on till we came to a river of blood in the middle of which a man was standing and on the bank of which there was a man with some stones in front of him. The man who was in the river came forward and when he wanted to come out the other threw a stone into his mouth and sent him back where he came from; and as often as he tried to come out he threw a stone into his mouth and he returned to where he came from. I asked what this was and they\" told me to come away. So we went on till we reached a green garden containing a huge tree at the foot of which were an old man and some boys and near which there was a man in front of whom there was a fire which he was kindling. My two companions took me up the tree and brought me into a house in the middle of the tree more beautiful than any I had seen in which were old men, youths, women and boys. They then took me out of it and brought me up the tree and took me into a more beautiful and more excellent house in which were old men and youths. Telling them that they had taken me round this night, I asked them to inform me about what I had seen, to which they agreed. \nThey said that the man I had seen having his jaw cloven was a liar who told lies which were reported from him and carried to the ends of the earth, so what I had seen would be done to him till the day of resurrection. The man whose head I had seen being pounded was a man whom God had taught the Qur’an but who had slept at night and neglected it and had not acted according to its teachings in the daytime, so what I had seen would be done to him till the day of resurrection. Those I had seen in the hole were fornicators and the one I had seen in the river was the one who devoured usury. The old man I had seen at the foot of the tree was Abraham, the boys around him were the children of men, and the one who was kindling the fire was Malik the guardian of hell. The first house I entered was the abode of the generality of believers, but this house was the abode of the martyrs. One of them informing me that he was Gabriel and that the other was Michael told me to raise my head, and when I did so I saw something like a white cloud (a version giving cumulus cloud) and they told me that would be my abode. I asked them to let me enter my dwelling, but they told me I had still some time to live which I had not completed and that if I had completed it I would have entered my dwelling.” \n\nBukhari transmitted it.",

One morning he said to them, “Two people came to me last night and rousing me told me to set out, so I set out along with them.” \nHe mentioned at length something similar to the tradition mentioned in the first section, but it contains this addition which is not in the aforementioned tradition: “We came to a luxuriant garden containing all kinds of Spring blossom in the middle of which there was a man who was so tall that I could scarcely see his head, so high it went up into the sky; and around the man there were more children than I had ever seen. I asked my companions who this was and who these were, but they told me to come away. So we went on and came to a huge garden than which I had never seen any larger or more beautiful. They told me to go up into it, and when we had done so we came to a city built of gold and silver bricks. When we came to the gate of the city we asked that it should be opened, and when that was done and we had entered we were met by men half of whose frame was like the most beautiful you could see while the other half was like the most ugly you could see. There was a river opposite flowing with water as white as pure milk, and my companions told them to go and plunge into that river. They did so and returned to us having had that ugliness removed from them and having become most beautiful in appearance.\" \nIn the exposition of this addition he mentioned, “The tall man who was in the garden was Abraham and the children who were around him were all who had been born and had died following the true religion.\" \nSome Muslims asked God’s messenger about the children of the polytheists, and he replied that they were there too. He continued: “The people who, were half beautiful and half ugly were people Who had mixed a good deed with another which was evil and had been forgiven by God.\"\n\nBukhari transmitted it.",
