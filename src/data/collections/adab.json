So he said to them: \"I beseech you in the Name of Allah that you enter me upon (the place of) 'Aishah because it is unlawful for her to vow to sever relations with me.\" So Al-Miswar and 'Abdur-Rahman approached with him under their upper garments until they sought her permission, saying: \"As-salamu 'alaiki wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu!

So, when they entered, Ibn Az-Zubair entered the screened place and hugged 'Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) and began beseeching her and wept. And Al-Miswar and 'Abdur-Rahman began to plead her to but speak to him and to accept from him, also saying to her: \"You know that the Messenger Allah ﷺ forbade what you know of abandonment and that it is not permissible for a man to abandon his brother over three nights.\" He said: So when they did a great deal of reminding and urging, she began remind them and weep, saying: \"I have made a vow which is a matter of very serious nature.\" They persisted in their appeal till she spoke with 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair.
