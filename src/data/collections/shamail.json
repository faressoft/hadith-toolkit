His hair was neither crisply curled nor lank; it was loosely curled. He was neither plump nor chubby-cheeked, and in his face there was a rounded quality. He was white with a reddish tinge, dark black-eyed, with long eyelashes. He had splendid kneecaps, elbow joints and shoulder blades, free from hair. He had a strip of hair from the top of the chest to the navel. The palms of his hands and the soles of his feet were thickset. When he walked, he moved as if he were descending a declivity, and when he looked around, he looked around altogether. Between his shoulders was the Seal of Prophethood, for he is the Seal of the Prophets. He was the best of the people in generosity, the most truthful of the people in speech, the gentlest of them in temperament, and the noblest of them in social intercourse. If someone saw him unexpectedly, he was awestruck by him, and if someone came to know him, he loved him.

He was taller than medium-sized, and shorter than the slender giant. His head was grand and impressive, with loosely curled hair. If his forelock became divided, he would part it. Otherwise his hair would not cross over his earlobes, and he would let it grow plentiful and long. He was bright of color, broad of forehead, endowed with arched eyebrows, perfect without being conjoined, with a vein between them that anger would cause to pulsate. The bridge of his nose was curved. He had a light that would rise over him, and someone who did not reflect on him would consider him haughty. He was thickly bearded, endowed with smooth cheeks, a wide mouth, cleft teeth, and a delicate strip of hair from the top of the chest to the navel. It was as if his neck were the neck of a statue shaped in pure silver. He was well proportioned in physique, firmly cohesive, with the stomach and the breast in even balance. He was wide-chested, broad-shouldered, endowed with stout limbs and very shiny bare skin. Between the top of the chest and the navel by a strip of hair like a line of writing, while his breasts and stomach were bare apart from that. He had hair on his arms and shoulders and the upper parts of his chest. His forearms were long. He had a sensitive touch of the hand. The palms of his hands and the soles of his feet were thickset. His extremities were well formed [sa’il (or he may have said sha’il)]. The hollows of his soles were very deep-set. His feet were so smooth that water bounced off them. When he left a place, he would go away striding decisively. He would tread inclining forward and walk comfortably. His gait was brisk. When he walked, it was as if he were descending a declivity, and when he looked around, he looked around altogether. He lowered his eyesight, and he spent more time looking at the ground than he did looking at the sky. The majority of his looking was observation. He would urge his Companions to proceed ahead of him, and he would be the first to greet anyone he encountered with the salutation of peace.”",

He would extol a blessing, however small, and he would not find fault with any aspect of it. He neither condemned nor praised those who enjoyed food and drink, and he would not be angered by this world. If the truth were overstepped, he would be so furious that he could do nothing but right the wrong. He would not be angry for his own sake or come to his own defense. When he beckoned, he beckoned with the whole of the palm of his hand, and when he was astonished, he turned it over, and when he spoke, he gestured with his hands, and placed his right palm over the base of his left thumb.

Wa in tagh-fir lahum fa-innaka antal azizul hakim.Translation: \"If Thou punish them, lo! they are Thy slaves, and if Thou forgive them, (lo! the are Thy slaves).Lo! Thou, only Thou, art Mighty, the wise\".Surah Maa-idah, 118.The Being that possesses great power, if He wills, He may forgive the criminal. The One that is all Wise, there is Wisdom and benefit in every act of His. The reason for Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam reciting this aayah while standing and also in the ruku and sajdah, and repeating it many times, is to bring to mind the two attributes of Allah, namely the attributes of justice and forgiveness. The whole scene on the day of qiyaamah will be of these two things. It is stated that Imaam Aa'zam Abu Hanifah RA. also recited the following aayah the whole night:Wamtaazul yauma ayyuhal mujrimun.Translation: \"But avaunt ye, O ye guilty, this day!\" Surah Yaseen, 58.In this aayah too the scene of qiyaamah is portrayed. That today the sinners should separate and distinguish themselves. What a severe and nerve-chilling command this is. Today they are together with the pious and holy people and benefiting from the barakaat (blessings) they receive, but at this moment the sinners will be separated from them.

Then he divided his section between himself and the people, so he was assigning that in particular to the common folk, and he was not keeping anything from them. His conduct in the section of the Community included preference for the people of excellent merit, with his permission, and its allotment according to the value of their excellent merit in the religion, for among them was the one burdened with one need, and among them was the one burdened with two needs, and among them was the one burdened with multiple needs. He would therefore preoccupy himself with them, and preoccupy them with what would benefit them and the Community, including questioning them about it and informing them of what would be appropriate for them. He would say: 'Let the one of you who is present inform the absentee, and notify me of the need of someone who is incapable of notification, for if someone notifies a Sultan of the need of someone who is incapable of its notification, Allah will establish his feet firmly on the Day of the Resurrection. Nothing but that will be mentioned in His presence, and it will not be accepted from anyone other than him. They will enter as seekers, and they will not separate except on the strength of an intuition, and they will emerge as guides (meaning to goodness).’”\nHe said: “Then I asked him about his exit: ‘How was he used to behaving in it?’ He said: ‘Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) used to hold his tongue with regard to anything that did not concern him. He used to bring people together and not alienate them. He would honor the noble, generous man of every community, and put him in charge of them. He would caution people and be wary of them, without concealing his good humor and his natural disposition from anyone among them. He would watch out for his Companions, and he would ask people about their affairs. He would present the beautiful in a favorable light and strengthen it, and he would reveal the ugly for what it was and weaken it. He was equitable, not argumentative. He remained vigilant lest others be negligent or deviate from the right path. He had a means of dealing with every situation. He would neither fall short of the truth, nor overstep it. Those who followed him were the best of people. The most meritorious in his sight were those most receptive to sincere advice and most elevated in status those most generous in consolation and support.’”\nHe said: “Then I asked him about his session, so he said: ‘Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) would neither stand up nor sit down without observing the remembrance of Allah. When he eventually joined a group of people, he would take whatever seat was available, and he instructed others to do the same. He would give each of his sitting companions his share of time and attention, and every one of them would feel equally honored. If someone sat with him, or conferred with him about a need, he would bear with him patiently, so that the person who had sought him out would be the first to leave. If someone asked him for something he needed, he would not send him away without what he had requested, or least some comforting words. His munificence and his good nature encompassed people such that he became a father to them, and they became truly equal in his presence. His session was a session of knowledge, forbearance, modesty, trust and patience. Voices were not raised there, there was no talk of women, and people’s lapses were not broadcast. They were on a par with one another, contending with each other only in piety, humbly revering the elderly and showing compassion for the young. They were solicitous to the needy, and took good care of the stranger.’”",

They therefore asked his wife: “Where is your mate?” She said: “He has gone to draw sweet water for us.” They did not have to wait long before Abu’l-Haitham brought a waterskin that he was carrying full, so he set it down, and came to embrace the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace), offering his father and his mother as ransom for him. Then he took them to his garden, and spread a carpet for them. Then he went to a date palm, brought a bunch of dates and set it down. The Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Have you not selected for us some of its ripe dates?” He replied: “O Messenger of Allah, I intended to let you choose or prefer some of its ripe and its unripe dates,” so they ate dates and drank from that water. Then the Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “By the One in whose Hand is my soul, this is some of the gracious favor about which you shall be asked on the Day of Resurrection: cool shade, good dates and cold water!” Then Abu’l-Haitham went to make a meal for them, so the Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Do not slaughter a milch-animal for us.” He therefore slaughtered a young she-goat or a young billy goat, and brought it to them, so they ate. The Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Do you have a servant?” When the answer was “No,” he said: “If a prisoner of war comes to us, come to us!” Then he (Allah bless him and give him peace) was brought two captives, unaccompanied by a third. Abu’l-Haitham then came to him, and the Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Choose from the pair of them,” so he said: “O Messenger of Allah, choose for me!” The Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “The person whose opinion is requested deserves to be trusted. Take this one, for I have seen him performing the ritual prayer, and expect well of him!” Abu l-Haitham then went to his wife and told her what Allah’s Messenger had said, so his wife said: “You cannot arrive at the truth of what the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) said about him, except by setting him free!” He said: “He is free, then!” The Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Allah has not sent any Prophet, nor any Caliph, without his having two intimate friends: one who commands him to do what is right and fair, and forbids him to do what is wrong and unfair, and one who will spare no effort to corrupt him.

Then Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) felt light in the head, so he said: ‘Find me someone I can lean on!’ Barira and another man therefore came to him, so he leaned on them.
